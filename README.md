## Heros Correction of the script

Fix VORP_METABOLISM using RedemRP:Reboot

- Consumed items are well placed in the hand
- The correct item model is displayed in hand when you use it and you no longer have the problem of the apple putting itself in the place of others
- You have the use of items like the fan, any type of tobacco, alcohol (Wine, Beer, Whiskey, Shampan glasses, Moonshine, Rum and others)
- You can adjust the effects of alcohol according to the type of alcohol consumed
- Totally OPEN source, you can modify according to your desires
- Set the model of each item that is consumed, you can find them here: https://rdr2.mooshe.tv/
- Changed UI for hunger and thirst needs using JavaScript to have it like health & Stamina, than around the map, especially if you use the minimap without GPS.
- Choose how to consume for each item: "eat" or "drink"
- You can set how to consume for animations, for example for stew or for bottle
